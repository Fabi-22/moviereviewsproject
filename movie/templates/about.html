<h1>About the Project</h1>

<p>
  Movie Reviews is a web application developed using the Django framework.
  The purpose of this application is to allow users to explore and search
  for movies in a simple and intuitive way.
</p>

<p>
  The application provides a list of movies stored in a database. Each movie
  includes essential information such as the title, a description, an image,
  and a URL with additional details about the movie.
</p>

<p>
  Users can search for movies by name, and the application will display
  all movies that match the search criteria. This functionality helps users
  easily find specific movies of interest.
</p>

<p>
  After logging in, users can publish reviews including the publication date,
  the content, and their name. Each user can edit and delete only their own reviews,
  respecting other users' contributions.
